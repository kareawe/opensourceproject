This team project involves developing a QR code reading program. To get started, ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies: pyzbar and OpenCV. You can install pyzbar using the command pip install pyzkar, and for OpenCV, use pip install opency-python. Additionally, make sure to install numpy by running pip install numpy. Remember to save the QR.jpg file in the same location as the program.
